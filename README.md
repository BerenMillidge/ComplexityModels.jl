# ComplexityModels.jl
Simple implementations of various models in the complexity and self-organised criticality literature. For my own educational purposes. Models here may not be polished nor complete. 

Currently Includes:
  * Abelian Sandpile model,
  * Bak-Sneppen model of evolution,
  * Schelling's agent-based-model of housing segregation,
  * A simple 2D Ising Model
